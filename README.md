# HomeRunBingo

HomeRunBingo allows anyone to play along everyday of the MLB season and fill out Bingo cards populated with the top Home Run hitters from across the league. When you have a player hit a Home Run, his square on your board is filled. Fill 4 squares in a row and you win!


We wanted to come up with something that was easy to play either at home or at a baseball game. This game was designed to make watching baseball games more entertaining to either a new baseball fan or a die hard fan. The goal we tried to accomplish was something simple that required little effort to play but still fun in the end.
